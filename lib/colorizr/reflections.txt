Q. How does your gem take advantage of Ruby's metaprogramming capabilities?

A. My gem uses instance_eval to create instance methods for the String class. It also has a method that uses define_method to create methods for each color.


Q. How long did you spend working on this project?

A. Approximately 2 hours of active programming, plus another two or three reviewing the previous lesson and researching Ruby metaprogramming.


Q. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

A. The most challenging part for me was using define_method to create all of the color methods. I spent more than half of my time on the project just trying to get that to work. In the end, it was a very simple mistake that was tripping me up - I forgot to actually call my create_colors method afterwards. This was incredibly frustrating until I figured it out. Then I just had to laugh.


Q. Where do you still have room to grow?

A. Well, it would help if I stopped overlooking simple steps like calling a method after writing it. ;)
